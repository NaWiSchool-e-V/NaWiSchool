Welcome to the NaWiSchool Adalogger Project repository! This repository contains the Arduino code and Fritzing diagrams for building and using the Adaloggers developed by the NaWiSchool team. NaWiSchool is a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting science and technology education among students.

## Introduction

The NaWiSchool Adalogger project focuses on creating data logging devices using the Adalogger V3 board, BME280 or MPU6050 sensors, and the NEO-6M GPS module. These devices are designed for educational purposes, allowing students to collect and analyze environmental data.

## Features

- Integration with TinyGPS++ for GPS data parsing.
- Utilizes Adafruit_Sensor, Adafruit_BME280, and Adafruit_MPU6050 libraries.
- Data logging to SD card and display output to OLED screen.
- Fritzing diagrams for building the Adaloggers.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup:** Build the Adalogger using the Fritzing diagrams provided in the [Fritzing Diagrams](#fritzing-diagrams) section.
2. **Code:** Upload the corresponding Arduino sketch to the Adalogger board. Refer to the [Code](#code) section for details.
3. **Data Collection:** Power on the Adalogger and start collecting data from the environment.

## [Code](code/)

Browse the `code` folder to find the Arduino sketches for the Adalogger project. Each sketch includes comments to guide you through the code and explain its functionality.

## [Fritzing Diagrams](fritzing/)

The `fritzing` folder contains Fritzing diagrams that provide instructions on how to assemble the Adalogger hardware. These diagrams help you build the Adalogger from scratch, making it easy for students and enthusiasts to recreate the devices.
